# Neighborhoodmap
Udacity-Neighborhood Map project
This app is meant to provide the user the distribution and size of earthquakes within a 50 mile radius of eureka, ca.
The 6 pin drops on the map represent the 5 locations my mother would most care about along with the eureka Police Dep.
When clicking on the pin drops, the user may find more info about each location, specifically the year built, the foundation type and the largest earthquake that building has withstood.
Additionally, the user may see a picture of each location by clicking on the name.  When the user has done so, they may also get the hours the specific location is likely to have individuals there.
