# Neighborhoodmap
Udacity-Neighborhood Map project
This app is meant to provide the user the distribution and size of earthquakes within a 50 mile radius of eureka, ca.
The 6 pin drops on the map represent the 5 locations my mother would most care about along with the eureka Police Dep.
When clicking on the pin drops, the user may find more info about each location, specifically the year built, the foundation type and the largest earthquake that building has withstood.
Additionally, the user may see a picture of each location by clicking on the name.  When the user has done so, they may also get the hours the specific location is likely to have individuals there.

once you have gotten the lay of the map of eureka, you may click 'Quake Update'.  this will then zoom out and provide a circle representing each earthquake within  the past 30 days and 50 miles (and exceeding magnitude 2.50 of eureka.  A list of the earthquakes will also appear.  you may click on either the list or the circle to get the magnitude and location for the quake.  This list and the circles fulfill the project's specifications.  If you would only like to see the quakes above a magnitude 2.5, you may click on the appropriate button and the subset of the quakes will appear.  If you have already clicked on a quake below 2.5 magnitude a shadow will remain (much like a real earthquake which is forever indellible).  Should you wish to remove the shadow, simply refresh the page.

As indicated on the website, the source for the earthquake data is the USGS site:  *Source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov

In order to run the map, do the following.  copy the index.html and main.css into a file on your directory.  Within that file, place a folder called js.  Within the js folder, place the app.js file and then create another folder called lib.  Within the lib folder, place the knockout-3.2.0.js file. 

this was an extremely difficult project and I owe much gratitude to both Karol and Sarah M.  Without their help I would have gargled Iocane powder at least 50 times already.
